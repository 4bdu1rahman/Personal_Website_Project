        <p> My name is Abdulrahman Oluwatoyin, I am 15 years old, an my interests are Computer Science and Engineering. I have a little bit of coding knowledge as I previously participated in two different programs. A long time ago I participated in a program called BEAM(Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics), and just last year I participated in another program called Google Code Next, which is where I found out about All Star Code. By pursuing my interests I how to find a job that I really enjoy doing, a job that does not feel like a job, and a job that pays really well too. </p>

        <p>I previously participated in a program called BEAM(Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics), which focused on developing critical thinking skills and creativity. During this program, I had a lot of opportunities to work independently on hands-on engineering projects using an Arduino to perform scientific experiments related to various STEM topics. I was able to work in teams with my peers to come up with project ideas and solve challenging problems by sharing our own knowledge collaboratively. I learned a lot from this program like using Arduino boards to make LEDlights and creating custom displays and I believe that all of these skills can be translated into this program as well.</p>

        <p>I also participated in a progtam called Google Code Next, and in this program, we learned how to create loops, functions, use variables, and much more using Python. The skills that I learned from this program and very fundamental, and I hope to learn a lot more from future programs including All Star Code.</p>
